IPL match predictor is a ML based prediction approach where the data sets and previous stats are trained in all dimensions covering all important factors 
Cricket is being played in many countries around the world. There are a lot of
domestic and international cricket tournaments being held in many countries. The
cricket game has various forms such as Test Matches, Twenty20(T20) Internationals, etc. Indian Premier League(IPL) is also one of them and has great popularity
among them. It’s a T20 cricket game league played to inspire young and talented
players in India. The league was conducted annually in March, April, or May and
has a huge fan base in India. There are eight teams that represent eight cities
that are chosen from an auction. These teams compete against each other for the
trophy.
On the other hand, Cricket is known as the game of chance. Fans and followers
are also concerned with predicting the winner of a tournament or match. The
outcome of the game is determined by the team’s luck, the performance of the
players, and the variety of other factor consideration. The match that takes place
before the day will also affect the prediction. Because of the huge popularity and
presence of the company, the stakeholders benefit significantly more. The size of
the data we use for analysis determine the accuracy of the data as well as the
records that are kept in order to predict the outcome.
Many natural factors affecting the sport, enormous media scope, and a huge betting market have given strong reason to model and train the sport from various
aspects. Although the complex and different rules determine the sport, the power
of players and their performances on a given day, and many other parameters play
an important role in influencing the best result of a match. Because the technology is improving at a faster speed and also the large market in betting and huge
demand for cricket has influenced the common people to use Machine learning
(ML) calculations to predict the results of cricket matches. Use of machine learning and data science makes life easier in every aspect, using ML and predicting
the outcomes before the match will help the players and coaches to analyze the
weak areas. We adopt several ML concepts and algorithms so as to predict the
winner of the cricket match. And machine learning is booming and firmly identified with (and frequently covers with) computational insights, which also focuses
on prediction-making through the utilization of technology. Its solid connections
to numerical improvement, which conveys strategies, hypothesis and application
areas to the sector. ML is a few of the time conflated with data processing where
the latter subfield concentrates more on exploratory information analysis and is
understood as supervised learning.
With the progression in innovation and additionally in sports, predicting the results of a match has evolved to be so basic. Cricket is one among the most popular
and most watched team games in the world. We are predicting the results of a T20
cricket matches using ML concepts like supervised learning to predict the champions of the matches. We utilize career statistics and also the team performances
like batting and bowling performances so as to train the models. However, the
unpredictable rules governing the sport, the capacity of players and different parameters play a necessary part in influencing the results of the match. Therefore
we are using supervised learning algorithms to predict the end result of the sport
and it will help the coaches of the team to understand and analyze where actually
the team is going wrong.
